# Botler for iOS 
Botler makes your next visit to an affiliated caf√© so much easier.
No more waiting for the waiter or queuing at the bar to give your order.
You just open Botler, order from the menu and pay as you check out in the app. Then the order will be delivered to your table or at the pickup point at the bar. 

It saves you time and prevents interruptions at the table.
Payment can be made with MobilePay or your credit card.
